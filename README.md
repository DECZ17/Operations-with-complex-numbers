# Operations-with-complex-numbers
What the project does?
Library with which you can solve 1. Sum 2. Product 3. Subtraction 4. Division 5. Module 6. Conjugate 7.Conversion between polar and Cartesian representations, in both directions. 8.Return the phase of a complex number.  with complex numbers.
Why the project is useful?
This project can be used by anyone who wants to start handling complex numbers or wants to save time when performing the operations we mentioned above. It is also useful for people who want to use or investigate quantum computing.
How to use the program?
In the main we can see that in the functions: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, two strings are sent, element 0 of the string m and n is the real part of the complex numbers, while element 1 is the imaginary part.
In the rest of the operations we only need a complex number, so we will only send the string m, with element 0 being the real part and 1 being the imaginary part of the complex number.
